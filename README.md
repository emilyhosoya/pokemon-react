# Primarily: they force you to think from the perspective of the user.
- As a user, I want to be able to search for a specific Pokemon so that I can see all of the important/relevant
    information about them.
- As a user (who is new to Pokemon and doesn’t know any names to search!), I want to click on a “View All” (or
    similar) button and look at page with pictures of all the pokemon so that I can click on the picture and learn
    more about them!
- As a user I want to click on a “View similar types” button for a specific pokemon and I will see a list of other
    pokemon with the same type.
- As a user, I want each Pokemon to have a “collect” feature so that I can add it to my collection if I like it.
- As a user, I want to have a “view collection” feature so that I can view my whole collection at any time
- As a user, I want there to be a “battle” feature where I can see who would win between two Pokemon (here,
you can select two Pokemon and have them battle, and based on some criteria, you determine the winner)
- As a user, I want there to be a “stats” feature where I can see the stats on a specific Pokemon (open to
interpretation how you want to handle this/what you want to feature!)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
